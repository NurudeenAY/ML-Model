# Car Price Prediction Model with Machine Learning using Jupyter Notebook

This is a project where I created a car price prediction model using machine learning techniques in Jupyter Notebook. The goal of the project was to build a model that could accurately predict the price of a car based on a set of features such as the car's make, model, year, mileage, and other relevant factors.

## Data Collection and Preprocessing

The first step in building the car price prediction model was to gather data from sources, including online car marketplaces and car dealerships. The data was then preprocessed to remove any missing values or outliers and to ensure that the data was in a format that could be easily used by the machine learning algorithms.

## Feature Engineering and Model Selection

After preprocessing the data, I used feature engineering techniques to extract the most relevant features for predicting car prices. Then I  used correlation matrix and heatmap to find relationships between the prices and other features.

## Model Evaluation and Deployment

I chose Decision Tree Regression as  the machine learning algorithm as I evaluated its performance using various metrics, including mean squared error and R-squared values. The final step was to deploy the model.

Overall, this project was a valuable learning experience that helped me develop my skills in machine learning and data science. The car price prediction model that I created can be used by car dealerships, car buyers, and anyone else who is interested in predicting the price of a car based on its features.
